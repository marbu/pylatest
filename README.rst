Pylatest
========

Pylatest project provides a set of tools which allows you to:

* Write a description of a test case using reStructuredText syntax.
* Include this description into a python source code directly, where it can
  be split into individual sections or actions to be performed, so that the
  description and test automation code are stored next to each other.

The reason behind this is to make synchronization between automatic test cases
and test case description documents simple while keeping the maintenance cost
low in the long term.

Pylatest Tools
--------------

Pylatest command line tools can be classified into several groups:

* ``pylatest2html`` and ``pylatest2htmlplain``: custom docutils clients
  which uses several docutils extensions (custom pylatest directives,
  roles, transformations ...)
* ``py2pylatest`` python source code extractor which can generate rst file
  from python source code with pylatest string literals
* various helpers (eg. ``pylatest-template``)

Usage with Sphinx
-----------------

To use *pylatest rst extensions* (eg. directives or roles) in a sphinx project,
you need to register them into docutils rst parser in a similar way as it's
done in ``pylatest2html`` command line client (see ``pylatest/main.py``).
Assuming you have pylatest installed properly (so that you can import pylatest
module without any problems), add following lines into ``conf.py`` of your
sphinx project::

    import pylatest.xdocutils.client

    pylatest.xdocutils.client.register_table()

Development and testing
-----------------------

For instructions how to install pylatest from source code or how to run unit
test, see ``HACKING.rst``.
