Development and testing
-----------------------

This section shows how to install latest development version directly from
source code.

First of all, clone git repository::

    git clone https://github.com/marbu/pylatest.git
    cd pylatest

Create new virtualenv environment and activate it::

    virtualenv .env
    source .env/bin/activate

And finally, install pylatest::

    python setup.py install

This way, you will have pylatest installed in local virtualenv without messing
with global system or user environment::

    $ cd /tmp
    $ which python
    ~/tvorba/pylatest/.env/bin/python
    $ which pylahello.py 
    ~/tvorba/pylatest/.env/bin/pylahello.py
    $ python
