=============================
 Pylatest contribution guide
=============================

Source code is managed in git repository hosted at gitlab:

https://gitlab.com/mbukatov/pylatest

Contributions are very welcome. Unit tests can be run with ``tox`` (see
``HACKING.rst`` file for details), please ensure the coverage at least stays
the same before you submit a merge request via gitlab.

Mirrors
=======

There is a mirror on github: https://github.com/mbukatov/pylatest which is
updated by gitlab hook once a day - so code there may not contain latest
updates.
